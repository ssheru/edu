3.2 git pull origin master
After using the above pull command the READ me file will be copied to desktop where .git is present.
o/p is Shershahs-MacBook-Pro:edureka sami$ git pull origin master

5.3 git add .
5.4 git commit -m "third commit"
5.4 do ls and see if the files are listed or not
5.5 git checkout master
5.6 git merge new ---->merging new to master
5.6 git rebase master ---> mergae multiple files to teh master(this should be done from the branch location)

step 6:
Pushing to central repo
6.1 from terminal enter ssh-keygen
6.2 it will ask passpharse just hit enter 2 times
6.3 key will be generated in /Users/sami/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

6.5 go to github-settings(user settings not repo settings)-SSH and SSH keys--andpaste the key --save
6.6 go to terminal ssh -T git@github.com
6.7 go to  terminal switch to branch-->git checkout new
6.8 git push origin new--->this will update everyong on github
6.9 git checkout master, git push origin master
